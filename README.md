·  COVID Protein Structure Prediction |  Regression Modelling
· Built Multi-linear Regression Model based on 2000 computer generated 3D COVID protein structures to make predictions.  
· Used multiple variable selection methods(forward, backward, stepwise) and performed 5-fold cross validation to avoid overfitting problems, removed multi-collinearity using VIF.
